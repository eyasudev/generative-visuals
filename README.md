# jsconfeu-generative-visuals

The ThreeJS/WebGL and Canvas code for the real-time generative animations shown during JSConfEU 2018 in Berlin. Created by [Matt DesLauriers](http://mattdesl.com/) and [Szymon Kaliski](http://szymonkaliski.com/), based on [Silke Voigts](http://www.silkevoigts.de/)'s designs and mood boards.

This was used during the opening of the event, as well as during breaks in between talks, and around the edges of speaker slides during talks. The visuals were used in a couple other select places, such as in TVs showing current schedule & speaker tracks. All shown with Chrome in real-time.

The main projection uses an aspect ratio of 6540x1200px, four projectors connected to a single GeForce GTX 1080 Windows PC running Chrome in full-screen.
